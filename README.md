# Orthophoto segmentation

This project provides a procedure and a software solution to make it (relatively) easy to create a training dataset for a topic of your choice and train a neural network to segment orthophotos.

Only open source software is needed, eg. QGIS and tensorflow.

Installation and usage instructions can be found in the [OrthoSeg wiki](https://github.com/theroggy/orthoseg/wiki)
